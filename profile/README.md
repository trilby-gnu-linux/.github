# Trilby GNU/Linux

Trilby GNU/Linux is a distribution of the GNU/Linux operating system designed to be an in-between of stability and modern.

## Things to Note:
- **Trilby GNU/Linux is an independent distribution.**
  - Guides online, typically written for Debian GNU/Linux and Debian GNU/Linux-based (Ubuntu, Linux Mint) systems will not work for Trilby GNU/Linux. Refer to official documentation instead.
- **Trilby GNU/Linux is a hobby project.**
  - While Trilby GNU/Linux is a serious project, it is not my main focus. As the project developers and gains traction I may hold it as a higher priority, but for now it is simply a project to see how far I can get into developing an independent GNU/Linux distribution on my own.
